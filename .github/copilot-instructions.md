# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
This is a React TypeScript project for Eyes on Ground, an item inspection company.

## Design Guidelines
For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

## Technical Standards
- Create beautiful, production-ready interfaces that stand out from generic templates
- Use modern design principles with thoughtful spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
- Implement smooth transitions, hover effects, and micro-interactions
- Use gradients, shadows, and proper color schemes for visual appeal
- Ensure responsive design that works across all devices
- Include proper accessibility features and ARIA labels
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Implement proper state management and error handling
- Create reusable components and maintain clean code structure

## Code Style
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Prefer TypeScript interfaces over types where appropriate
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Import icons from 'lucide-react'
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Include proper error handling and loading states
